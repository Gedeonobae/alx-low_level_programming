<h1>0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while</h1>
<ul>
  <li>0. - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

    You can find the source code here
    The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
    You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
    The output of the program should be:
        The number, followed by
            if the number is greater than 0: is positive
            if the number is 0: is zero
            if the number is less than 0: is negative
        followed by a new line
</li>
  <li>1. - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

    You can find the source code here
    The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
    You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
    The output of the program should be:
        The string Last digit of, followed by
        n, followed by
        the string is, followed by
            if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
            if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
            if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0

</li>
  <li>4. - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

    Print all the letters except q and e
    You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
    All your code should be in the main function

</li>
  <li>5. - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

    All your code should be in the main function
</li>
  <li>6. - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
