Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

    0x00. C - Hello, World
    0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
    0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
    0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops
    0x04. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
    0x05. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
    0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
    0x07. C - Recursion
    0x08. C - Static libraries
    0x09. C - argc, argv
    0x0A. C - malloc, free
    0x0B. C - More malloc, free
    0x0C. C - Preprocessor
    0x0D. C - Structures, typedef
    0x0E. C - Function pointers
    0x0F. C - Variadic functions
    0x10. C - printf
    0x11. C - Singly linked lists
    0x12. C - More singly linked lists
    0x13. C - Bit manipulation
    0x14. C - File I/O
    0x15. C - Simple Shell
    0x16. C - Doubly linked lists
    0x17. C - Dynamic libraries
    0x18. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
    0x19. C - Hash tables
    0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
    0x1B. C - Makefiles
    0x1C. C - Binary trees
    0x1D. C - Search Algorithms
